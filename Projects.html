										<td>Balatro Hand Simulator</td>
										<td>A personal project to calculate the average score that of a single hand of Balatro with a standard 52 card deck through simulation. Draw 8 cards then play 5 cards to create a standard poker hand. Score based on standard poker hand type and cards played. Face cards worth 10, numbers worth their value, A worth 11. Poker hands calculated <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Poker_Hands?file=BalatroHands.png">here</a> <br> <br> </td>

									<tr>
										<td>Machine Learning White Bloodcell project</td>
										<td>
											Collaborated with a team of three to develop an image classification model that identifies white blood cell types. I
											nitially used HOG-SVM for feature extraction, but later transitioned to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 
											for improved accuracy and detail recognition. Leveraged scikit-learn and deep learning techniques to achieve robust 
											performance, including consistent classification under image rotations.

									<tr>
										<td>Othello</td>
										<td>An in class project for "Intro to AI". Create the game Othello (aka reversi) then create an AI to play the solved game optimaly.</td>

									<tr>
										<td>Northrop-Grumman-Capstone-2023-2024</td>
										<td>Capstone project done in a group of 6 working with Northrop Grumman. The goal of the project was to create a simulated environment to track a robbers position in a city. Then, using a camera to identify the vehicle, predict where it is going, then intercept it's path with a police vehicle before it reaches its destination. <br><br></td>
										<td>This is a private project and the code cannot be shared at this time.</td>

									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>MassLFG</td>
										<td>A proeject done in "Software Development Methods and Tools"  to practice using API's and accesing data for a website. This project accesed the steam database to look for user information and determine what games they owned. Then, this data could be compared to other users and see what games they hand in common. This could be used to implement a chat for "Looking For Group" to find other players to play a game with accross multiple games. <br><br></td>

										<td>SupperSorry-Qt</td>
										<td>A project done in "Intensive Programing Workshop" to create a game using a Graphical User Interface. This game functioned similar to Sorry but added in more rules.<br><br></td>
