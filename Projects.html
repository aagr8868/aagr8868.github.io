										<td>Risk of Rain Shrine of Order Challenge</td>
										<td>I have done this project a few times. First, I did this using Java, I was able to run it in the terminal.
											I then rewrote it in javascript so that I can host it on my website. This project is a custom challenge in the game Risk of Rain 2.
											The challenge is to play the game while only picking up one type of item with each asscociated rarity.

										<td>Balatro Hand Simulator</td>
										<td>A personal project to calculate the average score that of a single hand of Balatro with a standard 52 card deck through simulation. Draw 8 cards then play 5 cards to create a standard poker hand. Score based on standard poker hand type and cards played. Face cards worth 10, numbers worth their value, A worth 11.

										<td>Machine Learning White Bloodcell project</td>
										<td>
											Collaborated with a team of three to develop an image classification model that identifies white blood cell types. I
											nitially used HOG-SVM for feature extraction, but later transitioned to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 
											for improved accuracy and detail recognition. Leveraged scikit-learn and deep learning techniques to achieve robust 
											performance, including consistent classification under image rotations.
