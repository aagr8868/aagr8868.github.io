					<h2 style="color:black">Interests</h2>
					<p style="color: black;"> Outside of school and work I have many other interests. I have two pets that I take care of, I like to listen to live music, and I 
						play videogames in my free time.

							<h3>My Dog Aurora</h3>
							<p>This is my dog Aurora. I take care of her while in school. She is a full bread pitbull and 12 years old at the time of writting this. She is one of the most friendly dogs you would meet.</p>

							<h3>This is my cat Panther</h3>
							<p>He acts more like a dog than a cat. He wants a lot of attention and consistently rubs up against people. I keep him indoors and he minds to himself. He really likes to play with string toys.</p>

							<h3>Lindsey Stirling at Redrocks</h3>
							<p>I like to listen to music and I always have fun at a live concert. I have made it to every Lindsey Stirling concert in Colorado and I plan to make it to each one in the future. I have also heard 3 Days Grace, The Colorado Symphony, and Trans-Siberian Orchestra.
								I go for the music itself and I love to watch the visuals.

							<h3>I like to play vieogames</h3>
							<p>Like many programers I like to play videogames in my free time. It's a fun hobby to get into since I can jump in and out of a solo game, or connect with frinds
								from accross the country instantly. I started playing on the Xbox, but I have played on most every concol from Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo. Most recently however I have been playing on PC 
								so that I don't need to worry about buying concole exclusives and I can play older games from my childhood like "A Link to the Past", "Halo 1-3", "Black Ops", while playing more modern games like "Marvel Rivals", "Risk of Rain 2", "The Talos Principle".
