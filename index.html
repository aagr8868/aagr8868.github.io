					<p> My name is Aaron Grissom, and I am a proud first-generation college graduate from the University of Colorado Boulder. Navigating higher education with little guidance has taught me how to balance academic goals alongside personal projects and professional responsibilities. Due to this, I have developed a disciplined mindset with an understanding of the intention I have to complete tasks I and others assign myself. This experience has shaped me into a highly self-aware and resilient individual who understands my limits and isn’t afraid to ask for support when needed. I take great pride in the work I produce, consistently striving for quality and clarity. My coding philosophy centers around long-term maintainability. I write code with maintainability in mind, so that even years later, I (or anyone else) can revisit my work and easily understand its purpose. This mindset, paired with my commitment to continuous growth, is what sets me apart from the average coder. </p>
					<p> All throughout my schooling, I have worked; for the past 3 years, I worked at Snarf's sandwiches, where I was promoted into a management role leading a team of 12 people. From this, I was able to balance my academic responsibilities with hands-on leadership experience and develop a strong work ethic with a focus on efficiency and quality. </p>
					<p> Working in management, a large portion of my role revolves around customer service. I have been recognized by colleagues and customers for my strong communication skills and ability to come up with creative solutions. I’m excited to start my career after graduation, and I’m actively looking for roles in software development and computer science at large.</p>
